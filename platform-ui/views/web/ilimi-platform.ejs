                            We have always known that individual coaching helps learners acquire knowledge and skills faster, with higher levels of mastery. But is it practical and economically viable for a global enterprise to offer such learner support 24x7? </p>

                            Ilimi’s Tutoring Engine is an innovation that allows coaching (anyone with expertise can be a coach) to be personalized and precision targeted at learners who really need it, right when they need it. Ilimi analytics automatically detects patterns in learner behavior, predicts when a learner is at risk and recommends the appropriate intervention needed by such learners.

                            Intervention is via precise content recommendations and online small-classroom coaching sessions. Coaches work with learners with similar learning needs. They suggest content from Ilimi's repository, ask learners to do specific exercises or invite them into small group sessions. This allows an enterprise or training business to effectively scale tutoring help to an unprecedented tutor-to-student ratio of 1:500 (as against 1:25 in traditional coaching).

                            Learning is more effective when simple learning content is enriched with relevant supplementary content from a variety of sources – illustrations, videos, practice questions, quizzes and more. Learning is further enhanced when such supplementary content is matched to individual learner preferences. But the human effort and cost of doing this for large number of learners across thousands of topics is a humongous task. And that is why we built the Ilimi semantic engine, so you can provide an immersive learning experience to every learner cost effectively.</p>
                        <p class="feature-content text-justify">Ilimi's Semantic Engine builds the taxonomy of concepts for any subject space, which could be thousands of concepts and the relationships among them – such as related concepts, pre-requisites and so on. It then extracts concepts covered in any piece of content and the pedagogic intent for each – whether the concept is introductory, explanatory, reference information etc. Cross referencing this with the taxonomy for the subject areas, the engine is now able to index thousands of relevant content elements from public sources and well as private corporate repositories.</p>
                        <p class="feature-content text-justify">With the content index in place, for any given learning content Ilimi can suggest pedagogically suitable additional content and even questions or exercises. Your content is now ready to adapt itself for various learner needs. And if you are not using the Ilimi learning platform, you could still enrich all your existing content by using our APIs. Simple, right?</p>
