# Allowed values:
# HA - High Availability
# SINGLE - Single mode, default.
# To run in High Availability mode uncomment this line:

# ha.server_id is the number of each instance in the HA cluster. It should be
# an integer (e.g. 1), and should be unique for each cluster instance.
ha.server_id={{server_id}}

# ha.initial_hosts is a comma-separated list (without spaces) of the host:port
# where the ha.host.coordination of all instances will be listening. Typically
# this will be the same for all cluster instances.

# Amount of slaves the master will try to push a transaction to upon commit
# (default is 1). The master will optimistically continue and not fail the

# lead to branched data (or loss of transaction) if the master goes down.

# Strategy the master will use when pushing data to slaves (if the push factor
# is greater than 0). There are three options available "fixed_ascending" (default),

# Limit the number of IOs the background checkpoint process will consume per second.
# This setting is advisory, is ignored in Neo4j Community Edition, and is followed to
# best effort in Enterprise Edition.
# An IO is in this case a 8 KiB (mostly sequential) write. Limiting the write IO in
# this way will leave more bandwidth in the IO subsystem to service random-read IOs,
# which is important for the response time of queries when the database cannot fit
# entirely in memory. The only drawback of this setting is that longer checkpoint times
# may lead to slightly longer recovery times in case of a database or system crash.
# A lower number means lower IO pressure, and consequently longer checkpoint times.
# The configuration can also be commented out to remove the limitation entirely, and
# let the checkpointer flush data as fast as the hardware will go.
# Set this to -1 to disable the IOPS limit.
